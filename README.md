# 👋 Heyy I'm Julien (aka Zoulienn 🧙‍♂️)

🎓 Currently leveling up as a 2nd-year Computer Science student @ Middlesex University Mauritius.  
💻 Backend wizardry is my jam — especially when it's in **C#**, **.NET**, and **JavaScript**.  
🧠 Always learning, always building, always looking to push my limits.

## 🚧 What I'm Working On

- 📚 Strengthening my understanding of **data structures** — especially hash maps, queues, trees, and their real-world applications.
- 🔍 Mastering **.NET backend architecture** — from EF Core to testing strategies and clean layering.
- 🐳 Docker-ing my dev environment like a boss. Running SQL Server on macOS inside containers? You bet. Feels like black magic, works like a charm.


## 🧑‍💻 Who Am I?

- 💥 Backend-focused dev who *lives* for clean code and smooth logic flows.
- 💬 Big fan of teamwork, memes, and deep-dive debugging sessions at 2AM.
- 🧪 Enjoy unit testing things I probably shouldn't be testing — just to be sure. MSTest for the win.
- 🐍 Python player by day, JavaScript juggler by night. Sometimes both. At the same time.
- 💢 Merge conflicts are my biggest fear… right after getting a beating by my girlfriend.
